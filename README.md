## Installing Rust

I recommend you install [rustup][rustup] and then run the following command to use 
the Rust nightly version:

```sh
$ rustup install nightly # or rustup update nightly
```

Although you can run a command from the nightly toolchain without switching to 
nightly (`$ rustup run nightly [command]`), you should switch to nightly:

```sh
$ rustup default nightly
```
