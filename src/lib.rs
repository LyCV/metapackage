//! A modern, (soon to be) GPU-accelerated computer vision library providing state-of-the-art 
//! implementations and performance.
//!
//! ## Philosophy
//! 
//! * __Application Driven__:
//! For a more research-driven approach, have a look at [illusions][illusions-github] 
//! and [mirage][mirage-github].
//! * __Well-Written Documentation__:
//! Documentation includes references, pseudo-code, brief descriptions illustrating the concept of the algorithms and data-structures, ..
//! * __Modular Design__:
//! The crate itself is made up of Î¼crates. Algorithms used by other algorithms can easily be replaced with an alternative.
